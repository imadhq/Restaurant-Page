# Restaurant-Page
This project is part of my learning journey with The Odin Project curriculum.

**Project Overview**
- The focus of this project is on leveraging DOM manipulation, modular code organization through the use of modules, and utilizing webpack to bundle assets for deployment. The objective is to develop a restaurant homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through DOM manipulation techniques, we'll dynamically render the website's contents. Modules will be employed to organize code logically and webpack will bundle assets efficiently for deployment purposes.

**Key Objectives**
- DOM Manipulation: Utilize DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically render the contents of the restaurant homepage.
- Modular Code Organization: Implement modular code organization using JavaScript modules to logically structure the project.
- Webpack Asset Bundling: Employ webpack to bundle assets efficiently for deployment, ensuring optimized performance of the website.
- Tabbed Browsing: Implement tabbed browsing functionality to navigate between different sections of the website (e.g. Home, Menu, About).
- Dynamic Content Generation: Dynamically generate content for each tab using JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience.
- Interactive User Interface: Develop an interactive user interface with seamless navigation and dynamic content updates, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Development Approach**
- NPM and Webpack Setup: Initialize npm and webpack in the project directory to streamline asset bundling and project management.
- Basic HTML Layout: Create a foundational HTML structure in the index.html file, establishing essential elements like header, navigation, and content div.
- Modular Organization: Utilize modules to organize project data and logic efficiently, promoting maintainability and code readability.
- Dynamic HTML Generation: Implement JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML content based on user interaction, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the webpage.
